Start Working from this Project - [Artificial Human Pacemaker](https://github.com/FreeHealthFoundation/artificial-human-pacemaker)


This project is an implementation of the informal specification of a pacemaker provided by Boston Scientific (2007 ). 
The specification is being implemented in accordance with the formal specification in Z proposed by Artur Gomes (2010 ). 

The project is underway at Free Health Foundation fully indipendently.

The purpose of the implementation is to make a real time Java approach to the development of a real-time 
embedded system. The virtual machine being used is JamaicaVM PE developed by aicas. 
To properly execute this code on your environment you must first install JamaicaVM 6.2 with Exclipse on your machine, 
configure the appropriate JRE ( JamaicaVM 6.2 ). 

Due to the complexity and limitations of resources, the current development version ( alpha) will have only some of the 
components necessary for execution in steady state and without the use of the accelerometer.
